# Enhancing Public Restroom Management 
with 
IoT Sensors
Project Definition:
In a world increasingly connected by technology, even the most fundamental 
aspects of daily life can benefit from innovation. The project at hand seeks to 
revolutionize public restroom management by harnessing the power of IoT (Internet of 
Things) sensors. The overarching goal is to provide real-time information to the public 
regarding restroom occupancy and cleanliness, all accessible through a user-friendly 
platform or mobile app. This ambitious project encompasses four key pillars: defining 
clear objectives, meticulously planning the IoT sensor deployment, crafting a usercentric web platform and mobile app, and seamlessly integrating these components 
using IoT technology and Python.
Design Thinking:
Defining Clear Objectives:
The first step in our design thinking journey is to define a clear set of objectives. 
Our project aims to deliver several key outcomes:
- Real-time information on restroom availability, helping individuals make informed 
decisions.
- Ongoing monitoring of cleanliness, ensuring a pleasant user experience.
- A substantial improvement in overall restroom efficiency, benefiting both the public 
and facility managers.
IoT Sensor Design:
The second phase involves the thoughtful deployment of IoT sensors within 
public restroom facilities. These sensors will serve as the project's eyes and ears, 
collecting critical data to drive decision-making. Occupancy sensors will detect human 
presence, while cleanliness sensors will assess the restroom's condition. Environmental 
sensors may also be incorporated to monitor factors like temperature and humidity, 
providing holistic insights.
Real-Time Transit Information Platform:
Central to our project is the creation of a user-friendly, web-based platform and 
mobile application. These interfaces will grant the public direct access to real-time 
data regarding restroom availability and cleanliness. Key design considerations 
include:
- A straightforward and intuitive user interface.
- Continuous real-time data updates for informed decision-making.
- Integration of mapping and navigation features to guide users to the nearest available 
restrooms.
- Implementation of notifications and alerts to enhance user experience.
Integration Approach:
Lastly, we must determine how IoT sensors will effectively communicate their 
data to the restroom information platform. A robust integration strategy will be 
developed to ensure data is collected, processed, and presented in a seamless manner. 
Python, with its versatility and data processing capabilities, will play a pivotal role in 
this integration.
By adhering to the principles of design thinking, this project will not only tackle 
the technical challenges but also place significant emphasis on empathy and usercentricity. Throughout the journey, we will continuously gather feedback, iterate on 
designs, and strive for excellence. The result will be a transformative solution that 
elevates public restroom management, offering convenience, cleanliness, and efficiency 
to the public and facility managers alike. Through technology and innovation, we aim 
to enhance a basic yet essential aspect of everyday life
